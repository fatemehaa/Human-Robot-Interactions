## How different degrees of control affect human-robot interaction with a robot tour guide in VR

In this project, we designed a robot in virtual reality to play the role of a museum tour guide. Three participant groups were defined with various degrees of control over the robot's explanations of museum exhibits: full control; partial control; and no control. We evaluated the agency, impression, and satisfaction of their experience with the robot and their level of control over it. Participants' interactions with the robot and exhibits in VR was recorded in _.json_ files, and the participants filled out questionnaires regarding their experience after the experiment. Overall, the results showed that participants with full control over the robot had the highest engagement levels, whereas the no control group had the lowest number of initial interactions. While the full control group experienced higher levels of agency, the partial and no control groups perceived the robot more positively.

My contributions in the project:
- Helping to develop the overall experimental design of the project
- Creating elements of the VR museum using Unity
- Conducting the experiment and collecting the measurements from the participants while in VR
- Preparing, cleaning, and visualising the quantitative data using python
- Conducted statistical analysis on the quantitative data using R
- Helping to draw the overall conclusions of the experiment and reporting it in the final project report
